# Elastic APM events intake API [apm-api-events]

::::{note}
Most users do not need to interact directly with the events intake API.
::::

The events intake API is what we call the internal protocol that APM agents use to talk to the APM Server. Agents communicate with the Server by sending events — captured pieces of information — in an HTTP request. Events can be:

* Transactions
* Spans
* Errors
* Metrics

Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP request body. This is known as [newline delimited JSON (NDJSON)](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec).

With NDJSON, agents can open an HTTP POST request and use chunked encoding to stream events to the APM Server as soon as they are recorded in the agent. This makes it simple for agents to serialize each event to a stream of newline delimited JSON. The APM Server also treats the HTTP body as a compressed stream and thus reads and handles each event independently.

See the [APM data model](/solutions/observability/apm/data-types.md) to learn more about the different types of events.

### Endpoints [apm-api-events-endpoint]

APM Server exposes the following endpoints for Elastic APM agent data intake:

| Name | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| APM agent event intake | `/intake/v2/events` |
| RUM event intake (v2) | `/intake/v2/rum/events` |
| RUM event intake (v3) | `/intake/v3/rum/events` |

### Request [apm-api-events-example]

Send an `HTTP POST` request to the APM Server `intake/v2/events` endpoint:

```bash
http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/intake/v2/events
```

From version `8.5.0` onwards, the APM Server supports asynchronous processing of batches. To request asynchronous processing the `async` query parameter can be set in the POST request to the `intake/v2/events` endpoint:

```bash
http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/intake/v2/events?async=true
```

::::{note}
Since asynchronous processing defers some of the event processing to the background and takes place after the client has closed the request, some errors can’t be communicated back to the client and are logged by the APM Server. Furthermore, asynchronous processing requests will only be scheduled if the APM Server can service the incoming request, requests that cannot be serviced will receive an internal error `503` "queue is full" error.
::::

For [RUM](/solutions/observability/apm/real-user-monitoring-rum.md) send an `HTTP POST` request to the APM Server `intake/v3/rum/events` endpoint instead:

```bash
http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/intake/v3/rum/events
```

### Response [apm-api-events-response]

On success, the server will respond with a 202 Accepted status code and no body.

Keep in mind that events can succeed and fail independently of each other. Only if all events succeed does the server respond with a 202.

### Errors [apm-api-events-errors]

There are two types of errors that the APM Server may return to an agent:

* Event related errors (typically validation errors)
* Non-event related errors

The APM Server processes events one after the other. If an error is encountered while processing an event, the error encountered as well as the document causing the error are added to an internal array. The APM Server will only save 5 event related errors. If it encounters more than 5 event related errors, the additional errors will not be returned to agent. Once all events have been processed, the error response is sent.

Some errors, not relating to specific events, may terminate the request immediately. For example: IP rate limit reached, wrong metadata, etc. If at any point one of these errors is encountered, it is added to the internal array and immediately returned.

An example error response might look something like this:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "<json-schema-err>", <1>
      "document": "<ndjson-obj>" <2>
    },{
      "message": "<json-schema-err>",
      "document": "<ndjson-obj>"
    },{
      "message": "<json-decoding-err>",
      "document": "<ndjson-obj>"
    },{
      "message": "too many requests" <3>
    },
  ],
  "accepted": 2320 <4>
}
```

1. An event related error
2. The document causing the error
3. An immediately returning non-event related error
4. The number of accepted events

If you’re developing an agent, these errors can be useful for debugging.

### Event API Schemas [apm-api-events-schema-definition]

The APM Server uses a collection of JSON Schemas for validating requests to the intake API:

* [Metadata](#apm-api-metadata-overview)
* [Transactions](#apm-api-transaction)
* [Spans](#apm-api-span)
* [Errors](#apm-api-error)
* [Metrics](#apm-api-metricset)
* [Example request body](#apm-api-event-example)

## Metadata [apm-api-metadata-overview]

Every new connection to the APM Server starts with a `metadata` stanza. This provides general metadata concerning the other objects in the stream.

Rather than send this metadata information from the agent multiple times, the APM Server hangs on to this information and applies it to other objects in the stream as necessary.

::::{tip}
Metadata is stored under `context` when viewing documents in {{es}}.
::::

* [Kubernetes data](#apm-api-kubernetes-data)
* [Metadata Schema](#apm-api-metadata-schema)

#### Kubernetes data [apm-api-kubernetes-data]

APM agents automatically read Kubernetes data and send it to the APM Server. In most instances, agents are able to read this data from inside the container. If this is not the case, or if you wish to override this data, you can set environment variables for the agents to read. These environment variable are set via the Kubernetes [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#use-pod-fields-as-values-for-environment-variables). Here’s how you would add the environment variables to your Kubernetes pod spec:

```yaml
         - name: KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
          - name: KUBERNETES_POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: KUBERNETES_POD_UID
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.uid
```

The table below maps these environment variables to the APM metadata event field:

| Environment variable | Metadata field name |
| --- | --- |
| `KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME` | system.kubernetes.node.name |
| `KUBERNETES_POD_NAME` | system.kubernetes.pod.name |
| `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` | system.kubernetes.namespace |
| `KUBERNETES_POD_UID` | system.kubernetes.pod.uid |

#### Metadata Schema [apm-api-metadata-schema]

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for metadata is defined on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/9.0/docs/spec/v2/metadata.json) and included below:

## Transactions [apm-api-transaction]

Transactions are events corresponding to an incoming request or similar task occurring in a monitored service.

#### Transaction Schema [apm-api-transaction-schema]

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for transactions is defined on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/9.0/docs/spec/v2/transaction.json) and included below:

```json

## Spans [apm-api-span]

Spans are events captured by an agent occurring in a monitored service.

#### Span Schema [apm-api-span-schema]

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for spans is defined on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/9.0/docs/spec/v2/span.json) and included below:

## Errors [apm-api-error]

An error or a logged error message captured by an agent occurring in a monitored service.

#### Error Schema [apm-api-error-schema]

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for errors is defined on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/9.0/docs/spec/v2/error.json) and included below:

## Metrics [apm-api-metricset]

Metrics contain application metric data captured by an {{apm-agent}}.

#### Metric Schema [apm-api-metricset-schema]

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for metrics is defined on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/9.0/docs/spec/v2/metricset.json) and included below:
