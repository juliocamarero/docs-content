# View monitor status [view-monitor-status]

::::{admonition} Deprecated in 8.15.0.
:class: warning

Use [Synthetic monitoring](/solutions/observability/synthetics/index.md) instead of the {{uptime-app}}.
::::

The **Monitors** page provides you with a high-level view of all the services you are monitoring to help you quickly diagnose outages and other connectivity issues within your network.

To access this page, go to **{{observability}} > Uptime > Monitors**.

::::{important}
Each endpoint, URL, and service represents a *monitor*.

::::

## Filter monitors [filter-monitors]

To get started with your analysis, use the automated filter options, such as location, port, scheme, and tags, or define a custom filter by field, URL, monitor ID, and other attributes.

## Monitor availability [monitor-availability]

The snapshot panel displays the overall status of the environment you’re monitoring or a subset of those monitors. You can see the total number of detected monitors within the selected date range, based on the last check reported by {{heartbeat}}, along with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

Next to the counts, a histogram shows a count of **Pings over time** with a breakdown of `Up` and `Down` counts per time bucket.

:::

Information about individual monitors is displayed in the monitor list and provides a quick way to navigate to a detailed visualization for hosts or endpoints.

The information displayed includes the recent status of a host or endpoint, when the monitor was last checked, its URL, and, if applicable, the TLS certificate expiration time. There is also a sparkline showing downtime history.

::::{tip}
Use monitor tags to display a custom assortment of monitors; for example, consider assigning tags based on a monitor’s hosted cloud provider – making it easy to quickly see all monitors hosted on GCP, AWS, etc.

::::

Expand the table row for a specific monitor on the list to view additional information such as which alerts are configured for the monitor, a recent error and when it occurred, the date and time of any recent test runs, and it’s URL.

## Integrate with other Observability apps [observability-integrations]

The Monitor list also contains a menu of available integrations. Expand the table row for a specific monitor on the list, and then click **Investigate**.

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs, metrics, or APM data relating to that monitor. You can choose:

* Show host, pod, or container logs in the [{{logs-app}}](../logs/explore-logs.md).
* Show APM data in the [Applications UI](/solutions/observability/apm/traces-ui.md).
* Show host, pod, or container metrics in the [{{infrastructure-app}}](/solutions/observability/infra-and-hosts/analyze-infrastructure-host-metrics.md).
